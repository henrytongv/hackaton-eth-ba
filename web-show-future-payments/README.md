# Web page
Show list of future payments to an account. Created using the Hedera functionality "Create scheduled transaction"

Prompt used to create this web page (then fixed and tweaked manually)
```
Create a web page with business corporate theme style with the title "Your future payments". Add the secondary title "List of payments for Mary". Add a table with 6 rows. Use two column headers: "Day of payment" and "Link to future payment in blockchain"



In the first column add dates, starting from tomorrow then add 1 day each next row. In the second column just add a link to google and make sure it shows as a clickable link
```
