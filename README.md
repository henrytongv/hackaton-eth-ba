# Project HPayRoll
Source code for Hackathon ETH Global Buenos Aires

Components:

- Web page that shows a list of possible investment options to an employee. Deployed at https://show-list-possible.onrender.com/ This web uses javascript to get values from Oracle-Pyth
- Web page that shows a list of future payments to an employee. Deployed at https://show-list-future-payments.onrender.com this web shows values generated by the java program also included in this repo
- Java program that uses Hedera SDK to create 6 payments to an employee in the future (by using the "Create scheduled transaction feature"). The transaction ids created by this program were copied to the "list of future payments" html page

## Additional technical details

- The web pages were deployed using the Render platform (deployed as static sites)
- The java program was initially prototyped in the Hedera Playground but edited and finished using the Eclipse IDE
- Java SDK version 25 was used but no special java feature was used. This should work with any version the Hedera Java SDK works with
